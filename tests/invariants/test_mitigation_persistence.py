"""Regression tests for three real bugs found this session while running the
first full track-1 comparison: soft_mitigation_only, remapping_only, and
layer_reset_only produced bit-identical results despite soft-mitigation and
remapping actually firing (34M/71.7M cell-touches logged) - verified to
reproduce against the pre-fix code (see docs/planning/project-setup-plan.md
for the verification transcripts), not written to pass against
already-correct code:

- Bug A: mitigation writes (remap) only touch conductance via
  handle.accessor.write() - system.synchronize() (called after every
  optimizer.step()) re-derives conductance from .weight every batch, erasing
  the correction before any forward pass benefits from it. Verified directly:
  a 122-cell remap was overwritten by one real training step + synchronize().
- Bug B: layer_reset was dead code on both backends - system.py checked
  `hasattr(module, "crossbars")`, an attribute no patched layer class in
  either backend ever defines, so reset_fn was always None regardless of
  config or health.
- Bug C: stuck-at faults self-healed within one batch in every mode except
  fault_aware_retraining (covered separately in tests/unit/test_system_
  retraining.py, generalized there) - not duplicated here.

Uses FakeCrossbar/make_handle via a fake backend module (same pattern as
tests/unit/test_system_retraining.py) so these exercise the real
system.py/dispatch.py/remap.py/self_healing.py orchestration without needing
crosssim or aihwkit installed.
