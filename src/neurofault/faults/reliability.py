"""Statistical time-to-failure models for fault injection - real applied
reliability engineering (Weibull wear-out, exponential constant-hazard,
Arrhenius temperature acceleration), not just another spatial distribution
option. faults/injection.py's `distribution` param (random/clustered/
gradient) answers "which cells, given how many must fail this round" - a
spatial question. The functions here answer "how many fail this round, and
does this cell's own history make it more or less likely" - a temporal/
physical question. Deliberately orthogonal to spatial distribution, not
combined with it in this pass (see docs/planning/project-setup-plan.md).

`cycles`/`delta_cycles` here are a simulation-time proxy - one unit per
inject_faults() call a cell survives - not a count of literal physical
read/write operations on real hardware.
