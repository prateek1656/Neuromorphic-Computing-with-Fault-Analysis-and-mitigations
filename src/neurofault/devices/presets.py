"""Device presets AIHWKit doesn't ship itself (verified via
`dir(aihwkit.simulator.presets.devices)` - no FeFET or STT-MRAM entry exists),
authored here rather than monkeypatched into aihwkit's own namespace. Follows
the same pattern as aihwkit's own presets (PCMPresetDevice, ReRamESPresetDevice,
etc. - confirmed by reading their source): a `@dataclass` subclassing one of
aihwkit's base pulsed-device models, with parameters fit to one real,
cited paper, not invented numbers.

Registered under devices/registry.py's aihwkit name_map ("fefet", "sttmram").
CrossSim has no equivalent - see devices/registry.py's module docstring for
why (one generic Rmin/Rmax model, no swappable per-technology device class) -
these two technologies are only richly modeled on the AIHWKit backend.
