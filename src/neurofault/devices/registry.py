"""Maps a device-technology name to its simulator-specific device class and
default parameters, dispatched per simulation backend (crosssim | aihwkit).
Replaces the VTEAM-only block that was duplicated verbatim in two places in
the original codebase - device AND backend choice are now config values, not
hardcoded if-statements.

Each backend library is imported lazily inside its own build_*_device()
function, so this module stays importable without any of them installed.
