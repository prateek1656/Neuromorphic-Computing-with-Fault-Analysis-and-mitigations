"""AIHWKit backend: replaces each patched Linear/Conv2d layer with a real
AIHWKit analog equivalent whose forward pass computes through the same
per-tile matrix this module's ConductanceAccessor reads and writes.

Root cause found and worked around this session: AIHWKit's default tile
(`SingleRPUConfig`, backed by its compiled RPU C++ extension) is broken -
`AnalogLinear`/`AnalogConv2d` construction fails with `RuntimeError: Invalid
weights dimensions` on every platform tested (macOS arm64, Linux x86_64),
every device preset, with or without bias. Confirmed the bug lives in the
compiled binding itself, not the nn.Module wrapper: calling the lowest-level
tile's set_weights() directly (bypassing from_digital()/reset_parameters()
entirely) reproduces the identical failure - so there is no lower-level way
to route around it. AIHWKit ships a second, pure-PyTorch tile implementation
- `TorchInferenceRPUConfig` (tile_class=TorchInferenceTile,
simulator_tile_class=TorchSimulatorTile) - that never touches the broken
binding. Verified hands-on: from_digital() works for both layer types, a
real forward pass computes through the tile (a written fault measurably
changes output), and the existing device-preset classes already used by
devices/registry.py (PCMPresetDevice, ReRamESPresetDevice, etc.) work
unchanged when assigned as `rpu_config.device = preset_cls()` *after*
construction (passing `device=` as a TorchInferenceRPUConfig() constructor
kwarg raises TypeError - this config class takes the device post-init).

Unit-space caveat, same as crosssim_backend.py: AIHWKit's tile.get_weights()/
set_weights() operate in the layer's own weight-space (not literal Ohms/
Siemens), and that range is signed - so build_handles() below derives this
handle's r_on/r_off from the tile's weight *magnitude* (symmetric
[-magnitude, +magnitude] as [g_min, g_max]) rather than its raw signed
bounds, for the exact same reason crosssim_backend.py does: deriving r_off
from a negative raw bound would flip HealthMonitor's g_min/g_max ordering
for an all-negative-weight layer, since 1/x is order-reversing for negative
x. See crosssim_backend.py's module docstring for the fuller reasoning.

Bias handling differs from CrossSim, though: AIHWKit's tile.set_weights(weight,
bias)/get_weights() always take/return bias together - there is no
"digital bias" toggle at the tile level the way CrossSim's bias_rows=0
keeps bias out of the accessor entirely. So AIHWKitAccessor caches the
layer's bias once at construction and passes it through unchanged on every
write() - mitigation code only ever supplies a weight-shaped matrix, same as
every other backend's ConductanceAccessor.write(matrix) signature.

crossbar_config.tile_shape IS wired, via rpu_config.mapping.max_output_size/
max_input_size - intuitively named (verified: max_output_size=4 on a
Linear(20,16) layer produced 4 tiles of shape (4,20), i.e. constrains
out_features as the name suggests - unlike CrossSim's inverted rows_max/
cols_max, see crosssim_backend.py). These already default to 512/512 (not
unlimited) - this backend has been silently tiling all along whenever a
layer exceeds 512 in either dimension; _build_rpu_config() below just makes
that an explicit, configured value instead of AIHWKit's hardcoded default.
build_handles() already iterates analog_tiles() per-tile, so multi-tile
layers were already handled correctly before this - no further changes
needed there. mapping_routine_for() below still only covers the common
single-tile-per-layer case, same conservative stance as the other backends -
a multi-tile layer leaves layer_reset unavailable (system.py already
degrades gracefully) rather than risk a wrong reset.

ADC/DAC resolution (crossbar_config.adc_resolution/dac_resolution) IS wired:
TorchInferenceRPUConfig().forward (IOParameters) already defaults to
non-ideal quantization out of the box - inp_res/out_res are resolution step
sizes, not bit counts, following the formula res = 1/(2**bits - 2) (verified
by matching AIHWKit's own defaults: inp_res=0.00794=1/(2**7-2), i.e. its
un-configured default is already a 7-bit DAC; out_res=0.00196=1/(2**9-2), a
9-bit ADC). _build_rpu_config() below applies that same formula from our own
config values instead of leaving AIHWKit's hardcoded defaults in place.

crossbar_config.circuit_topology (§5.2 - 1T1R/0T1R/1S1R) is NOT supported on
this backend - real, verified constraint, not a wiring gap. AIHWKit's
IOParameters does expose real fields for exactly this (forward.r_series,
forward.ir_drop/ir_drop_g_ratio), and crosssim_backend.py wires the CrossSim
equivalent successfully - but TorchInferenceTile (this backend's only
working tile, see above: the default SingleRPUConfig tile is broken)
explicitly refuses both: AIHWKit's own analog_mvm.py::check_support() raises
`ConfigError("IR drop not supported in torch tile")` and
`ConfigError("Voltage offset or R-series not supported in torch tile")`,
confirmed by direct construction attempts. _build_rpu_config() below raises a
clear error if circuit_topology is set for this backend rather than silently
ignoring it - use simulator="crosssim" for this axis.

crossbar_config.devices_per_synapse (§5.2 - multi-device/bit-slicing) IS
wired: when >1, the resolved device class is wrapped as
`VectorUnitCell(unit_cell_devices=[device_cls() for _ in range(n)])` instead
of assigned directly as `device_cls()`. Verified directly: VectorUnitCell
constructs fine under TorchInferenceRPUConfig, a fault write still changes
the forward pass, and its default update_policy=ALL already lets a normal
optimizer.step() reach every constituent device with no extra
synchronize() call - confirmed with a real multi-step Adam probe (a first,
looser torch.allclose check gave a false negative; re-verified with an
explicit weight-diff before trusting it as real, not a repeat of this
project's CrossSim training-sync bug).
