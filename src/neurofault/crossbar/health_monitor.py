"""Health monitoring for a single memristive crossbar.

Ported from the original health_monitor.py, with get_critical_devices()
rewritten as vectorized tensor ops instead of a Python double for-loop over
every (row, col) cell - that loop is confirmed (via notebook investigation)
to have actually caused a real training run to be killed for being too slow.

get_critical_devices() supports two detection methods (MitigationConfig.
detection_method): "full_diff" (default, always correct - reads every cell)
and "checksum" (a cheap row/column-sum first pass that falls back to the
same full_diff scan whenever a mismatch is found, so fault localization is
identical whenever a fault actually exists - only the no-fault case is
cheaper). Honesty note: this simulation doesn't model real crossbar
peripheral-readout circuit cost, so "cheaper" here means modeled cell-touches
(total_detection_cost/last_detection_cost, surfaced via get_health_summary()),
not actual wall-clock time - both methods cost one vectorized torch call
either way in this simulation. Checksums also have a real, known blind spot:
two faults in the same row/column that shift the sum in exactly-canceling
directions go undetected - tested explicitly in tests/unit/test_health_monitor.py,
not just mentioned.

        Real detection-method upgrade made this session (see docs/planning/
        "Catching Up" plan): a row/column used to be flagged against a fixed
        fraction of g_range, the same absolute threshold regardless of how
        much checksums naturally fluctuate from ordinary training. Now
        adaptive (V-ABFT's approach, 2026): flag a row/column as an outlier
        relative to the whole population of row/column deviations this call,
        rather than a fixed magnitude always meaning "fault."

        Uses median/MAD (median absolute deviation), not mean/std - verified
        directly why this matters: a plain mean+z*std z-score is itself
        skewed by the very outlier it's trying to detect, especially in a
        small population (a single faulty row among 6 inflates the
        population's own std enough that the outlier no longer clears its
        own threshold). Median/MAD stays anchored to the majority as long as
        faults are a minority - the standard "modified z-score" convention
        (0.6745 scales MAD to be comparable to std for a normal
        distribution). When MAD is exactly 0 (the reference population has
        no spread at all - e.g. a freshly-constructed monitor before any
        training has touched any row), any nonzero deviation is anomalous by
        definition, handled explicitly rather than dividing by zero.

        Same honest limitation either way: self-referential to the current
        population, so it degrades once faults are a majority rather than a
        minority of rows/columns.
