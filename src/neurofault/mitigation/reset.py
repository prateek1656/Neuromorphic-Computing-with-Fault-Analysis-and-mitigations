"""Layer reset: restore a layer's weights and re-derive its crossbar
conductances the same way the backend derived them originally.

Fixes the original codebase's bug #5: `crossbar.conductance_matrix.copy_(
module.weight.data)` copied the raw weight tensor directly into the
conductance matrix, ignoring the actual weight->conductance mapping and
Scheme.DoubleColumn's split into two separate crossbars with a different
shape than the weight tensor - it silently no-op'd behind a bare
`except Exception: print(...)`.

Here, failure is never silent: `apply_layer_reset` returns False and logs
the real exception; it never reports success without having actually
rewritten every crossbar handle for the layer.

Real design flaw found and fixed 2026-09-13 (see
docs/planning/project-setup-plan.md §13-14): whole-layer reset wipes ALL of
a layer's weights back to their random pre-training values, discarding
every batch of legitimate learning along with whatever fault it was meant
to correct - measured directly, robust across 3 seeds, actively worse than
no mitigation at all (11.80% vs 41.57% mean final accuracy), even after a
cooldown throttle cut how often it fires. The fix is `positions`: reset only
the specific crossbar cells that are actually critical, leaving every other
cell (and the training signal already encoded there) untouched.
