"""Soft mitigation: nudge a device's conductance partway toward mid-range.

Models correction of drift/variability, not a fix for a hardware-stuck
device (a real stuck-at-HRS/LRS device can't respond to a write pulse at
all - that distinction belongs to the caller/dispatch layer, which decides
whether soft mitigation is the appropriate strategy for a given device).
